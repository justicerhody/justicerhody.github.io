    "section": "",
    "text": "The Green Bay Packers have had a long history in professional football, dating back to the founding of the franchise in 1921. Along the way, they have been one of the most successful franchises in the NFL.\nA large part of that is due to the quarterback play, especially the Big Four of Bart Starr, Brett Favre, Aaron Rodgers, and Jordan Love. But in between these four gentleman, were a run of quarterbacks that can only be described as average.\nThe Packers were not very good after the Starr years and before Favre came to town, and with names like John Hadl, David Whitehurst, and Scott Hunter, Packers fans had to endure a less than desireable run of starting quarterback play. Let’s explore who among the crop of average is the most above average. Let’s first compare all Packers QB’s since 1960 to the rest of the NFL on a bubble chart, and see how they stack up.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\n\npassing &lt;- read_csv(\"passingstats.csv\")\n\ngoodpassers &lt;- passing |&gt; filter (att &gt; 150)\n\ngb &lt;- goodpassers |&gt; filter (team == \"GNB\")\n\ngbmeh &lt;- gb |&gt; filter(!player %in% c(\"Bart Starr\", \"Brett Favre\", \"Aaron Rodgers\", \"Jordan Love\"))\n\ngbmehlong &lt;- gbmeh |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(td, int),\n    names_to = \"Stat\",\n    values_to = \"Value\"\n  )\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=goodpassers, aes(x=yds, y=cmp_percent, size=td), color=\"lightgrey\", alpha = .3) + \n  geom_point(data=gb, aes(x=yds, y=cmp_percent, size=td), color=\"darkgreen\", alpha = .3) +\n  scale_size(range=c(3,8)) + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2559.794) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 58.11859) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=gb,\n    aes(x=yds, y=cmp_percent, label=player)\n  ) +  labs(\n    x= \"Passing Yards\",\n    y= \"Completion Percentage\",\n    size= \"TD's\",\n    title= \"Packers QB's are decent historically\",\n    subtitle= \"Aaron Rodgers kinda dominates the chart, but Lynn Dickey sneaks his way onto the edge of the good quadrant.\",\n    caption= \" Source: Pro Football Reference | Graphic By Justice Rhody\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10)\n  ) + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n     panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot surprisingly, Aaron Rodgers finds his way into the good quadrant of the bubble chart, but Lynn Dickey finds his way into the middle of the chart, so for the average QB’s, it’s not a bad start. However, most of the average QB’s find themselves in the bottom left quadrant, with a low completion percentage and a low number of passing yards. This can only mean they weren’t super productive, and the records would reflect that.\nNow, let’s compare the average QB’s touchdown to interception ratio on a stacked bar chart, to get a better idea of who the best one is, and what the numbers look like. I know it’s picking the best of a middling bunch, but that’s part of the fun of the project.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=gbmehlong, aes(x=reorder(player, Value), weight=Value, fill=Stat)) + \n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#FFB612\", \"darkgreen\"), name=\"Ratio\", labels=c(\"INT\", \"TD\")) +\n  coord_flip() +  \n  labs(\n    x= \"Player\",\n    y= \"TD/INT\",\n    title= \"There is a lot of mediocre here, like a lot\",\n    subtitle= \"Lynn Dickey has a lot of touchdowns, but even more interceptions. Don Majkowski has a decent ratio.\",\n    caption= \" Source: Pro Football Reference | Graphic By Justice Rhody\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10)\n  ) + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n     panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo after looking at the chart, Lynn Dickey has the best numbers because he played the longest, but Don Majkowski and Randy Wright also make decent statements, with the Magic Man having the best TD/INT ratio of all the QB’s. There are some bad performances however, as Dickey has almost 300 interceptions, and Scott Hunter and John Hadl were certainly experts at giving the other team the ball in their short stints in the green and gold.\nFinally, let’s evaluate the average QB’s against the Big Four, and see ultimately who has the best case for being the best QB outside of the Big Four. Let’s put them all on a scatterplot and see who has the best case.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=gb, aes(x= yds, y= td), color= \"darkgreen\") +\n  geom_smooth(data=gb, aes(x= yds, y= td), method= \"lm\") +  \n  geom_text_repel(data=gbmeh, aes(x= yds, y= td, label= player)) +\n  geom_encircle(data=gbmeh, aes(x= yds, y= td), s_shape=.02, expand=.01, colour=\"red\") +\n  labs(\n    x= \"Passing Yards\",\n    y= \"Touchdowns\",\n    title= \"Lynn Dickey is the closest to the Big Four\",\n    subtitle= \"Starr, Favre, Rodgers and Love are all good, but Don Majkowski and Lynn Dickey aren't bad at all.\",\n    caption= \" Source: Pro Football Reference | Graphic By Justice Rhody\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10)\n  ) + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n     panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo after viewing all of the evidence, it can be concluded that Lynn Dickey and Don Majkowski are the best Packers QB’s outside of the Big Four of Starr, Favre, Rodgers, and Love. Dickey was actually close to the first 30/30 season (sorry Jameis) in 1983, posting 32 TD’s and 29 INT’s while also leading the NFL in passing yards.\nMajkowski led the NFL in passing yards and completions in 1989, while finishing 2nd in the MVP voting. An honorable mention goes to Randy Wright, who ended up having the 3rd best Packers career among the average QB’s."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Premier League first came to fruition at the start of the 1992-93 season. Before that, the English top flight had been simply known as the First Division.\nLeeds United enjoyed several periods of success in the First Division, especially the “Dirty Leeds” teams managed by Don Revie from 1961-1974 that won two top flight titles and one Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, which is now more widely known as the Europa League.\nSince the Premier League came about, Leeds have been participants in 16 total season, including this current campaign. This season’s side has certainly had ups and downs, but lately it has been a lot more downs than ups. So it can reasonably be asked, is this the worst Leeds United side of the Premier League Era?\nLet’s evaluate some numbers really quick.\nThe first thing that we should look at is how this Leeds squad matches up against the rest of the Premier League.\nThe way we’re going to look at this is by comparing projected goals and projected goals allowed, using an algorithm of xG/90 and xGA/90 both home and away, and multiplying the xG and xGA by the number of home and away games remaining for each side, then adding those totals up with the existing goals and goals allowed totals from the 11 fixtures already played this season, to get a rough projection of where these teams will end up at the end of the campaign.\nNext, let’s put all 20 Premier League sides on a dumbbell chart and see how they stack up against each other in terms of the projected goals and goals allowed, with a blue dot on the right being a positive sign, and a red dot on the right being a negative sign.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nPL_Leeds_Data &lt;- read_csv(\"PL Leeds Data.csv\")\n\ncurrentpl &lt;- PL_Leeds_Data |&gt; \n  filter(Season == \"2025\")\n\nleeds &lt;- PL_Leeds_Data |&gt; \n  filter(Squad == \"Leeds United\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=currentpl,\n    aes(y=reorder(Squad,Gls...9), x=Gls...9, xend=GlsA),\n    size = 2,\n    colour= \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"blue\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    x= \"Goals Scored\",\n    y= \"Goals Allowed\",\n    title= \"Leeds isn't a potent attacking team this season\",\n    subtitle= \"The Lilywhites don't have the worst ratio in the Premier League, but they are down with some bad sides for projected goals allowed and projected goals scored.\",\n    caption= \" Source: FBRef | Graphic By Justice Rhody\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=7)\n  ) + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n     panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter looking at the chart, Leeds United is in the bottom 5 in terms of projected goals scored for the season. They aren’t the worst attacking side in the division, but they are down with some of the other relegation fodder.\nHowever, defensively they are an okay team, certainly mid-table caliber, so that is a positive sign.\nNow let’s take a historical glance and focus on how this Leeds squad compares against some of the previous iterations of Leeds United in the Premier League.\n\n\nCode\nleeds |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Gls...9)) |&gt; \n  select(Squad, Season, Gls...9, GlsA) |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    Gls...9 = \"Goals\",\n    GlsA = \"Goals Allowed\") |&gt; \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"The Current Leeds Squad doesn't measure up to the Golden Era\",\n    subtitle = \"This season's side is on pace to be towards the bottom of Leeds squads in the Premier League.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Justice Rhody  |  **Source:** FBRef\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"lightblue\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"yellow\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Season == \"2025\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Current Leeds Squad doesn't measure up to the Golden Era\n\n\nThis season's side is on pace to be towards the bottom of Leeds squads in the Premier League.\n\n\nSquad\nSeason\nGoals\nGoals Allowed\n\n\n\n\nLeeds United\n1993\n63\n39\n\n\nLeeds United\n2000\n63\n43\n\n\nLeeds United\n1998\n61\n34\n\n\nLeeds United\n2020\n60\n54\n\n\nLeeds United\n1999\n57\n43\n\n\nLeeds United\n1994\n56\n38\n\n\nLeeds United\n1992\n55\n62\n\n\nLeeds United\n2001\n54\n37\n\n\nLeeds United\n2002\n54\n57\n\n\nLeeds United\n1997\n52\n46\n\n\nLeeds United\n2022\n45\n78\n\n\nLeeds United\n2021\n42\n79\n\n\nLeeds United\n2003\n40\n79\n\n\nLeeds United\n1995\n38\n57\n\n\nLeeds United\n1996\n27\n38\n\n\nLeeds United\n2025\n10\n20\n\n\n\nBy: Justice Rhody | Source: FBRef\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain we find that Leeds isn’t measuring up well in terms of attacking numbers, but defensively they project to be pretty solid, and that removes this team from being in the bottom five Leeds squads at least on the table.\nBut how do they stack up on a scatterplot that also has a regression attached to it? Are they better than the average Leeds Premier League side over the last 16 seasons?\n\n\nCode\nleeds2025 &lt;- leeds |&gt; \n  filter(Season == \"2025\") \n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=leeds, aes(x= GlsA, y=Gls...9)) +\n  geom_point(data=leeds2025, aes(x= GlsA, y=Gls...9), color= \"blue\") +\n  geom_smooth(data=leeds, aes(x= GlsA, y=Gls...9), method= \"lm\") +  \n  geom_text_repel(data=leeds, aes(x= GlsA, y=Gls...9, label= Season)) +\n  geom_encircle(data=leeds2025, aes(x= GlsA, y=Gls...9), s_shape=.03, expand=.03, colour=\"red\") +\n  labs(\n    x= \"Goals Scored\",\n    y= \"Goals Allowed\",\n    title= \"The Current Leeds squad isn't actually that awful\",\n    subtitle= \"Based on projected goals and goals allowed, this Leeds squad is close to middle of the pack historically, and there is worse below them.\",\n    caption= \" Source: FBRef | Graphic By Justice Rhody\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=8)\n  ) + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n     panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter looking at the chart, we can see that Leeds is projected to fall below the level of an average Leeds squad in the Premier League, and on the chart are worse than the 2022 squad that got relegated to the Championship.\nBut we can also conclude by looking at the chart that they aren’t the worst Leeds United side of the Premier League era.\nThat honor belongs to the 1996-97 Leeds United squad, who actually finished 11th in the Premier League by allowing the 4th-fewest goals in the league, but also scored the least amount in the league by 3 goals, falling below relegated Nottingham Forest and relegated arch-rivals Sunderland in that abysmal attacking season."
