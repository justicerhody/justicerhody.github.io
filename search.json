    "section": "",
    "text": "The Premier League first came to fruition at the start of the 1992-93 season. Before that, the English top flight had been simply known as the First Division.\nLeeds United enjoyed several periods of success in the First Division, especially the “Dirty Leeds” teams managed by Don Revie from 1961-1974 that won two top flight titles and one Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, which is now more widely known as the Europa League.\nSince the Premier League came about, Leeds have been participants in 16 total season, including this current campaign. This season’s side has certainly had ups and downs, but lately it has been a lot more downs than ups. So it can reasonably be asked, is this the worst Leeds United side of the Premier League Era?\nLet’s evaluate some numbers really quick.\nThe first thing that we should look at is how this Leeds squad matches up against the rest of the Premier League.\nThe way we’re going to look at this is by comparing projected goals and projected goals allowed, using an algorithm of xG/90 and xGA/90 both home and away, and multiplying the xG and xGA by the number of home and away games remaining for each side, then adding those totals up with the existing goals and goals allowed totals from the 11 fixtures already played this season, to get a rough projection of where these teams will end up at the end of the campaign.\nNext, let’s put all 20 Premier League sides on a dumbbell chart and see how they stack up against each other in terms of the projected goals and goals allowed, with a blue dot on the right being a positive sign, and a red dot on the right being a negative sign.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nPL_Leeds_Data &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Documents/PL Leeds Data.csv\")\n\ncurrentpl &lt;- PL_Leeds_Data |&gt; \n  filter(Season == \"2025\")\n\nleeds &lt;- PL_Leeds_Data |&gt; \n  filter(Squad == \"Leeds United\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=currentpl,\n    aes(y=reorder(Squad,Gls...9), x=Gls...9, xend=GlsA),\n    size = 2,\n    colour= \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"blue\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    x= \"Goals Scored\",\n    y= \"Goals Allowed\",\n    title= \"Leeds isn't a potent attacking team this season\",\n    subtitle= \"The Lilywhites don't have the worst ratio in the Premier League, but they are down with some bad sides for projected goals allowed and projected goals scored.\",\n    caption= \" Source: FBRef | Graphic By Justice Rhody\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=7)\n  ) + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n     panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter looking at the chart, Leeds United is in the bottom 5 in terms of projected goals scored for the season. They aren’t the worst attacking side in the division, but they are down with some of the other relegation fodder.\nHowever, defensively they are an okay team, certainly mid-table caliber, so that is a positive sign.\nNow let’s take a historical glance and focus on how this Leeds squad compares against some of the previous iterations of Leeds United in the Premier League.\n\n\nCode\nleeds |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Gls...9)) |&gt; \n  select(Squad, Season, Gls...9, GlsA) |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    Gls...9 = \"Goals\",\n    GlsA = \"Goals Allowed\") |&gt; \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"The Current Leeds Squad doesn't measure up to the Golden Era\",\n    subtitle = \"This season's side is on pace to be towards the bottom of Leeds squads in the Premier League.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Justice Rhody  |  **Source:** FBRef\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"lightblue\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"yellow\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Season == \"2025\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Current Leeds Squad doesn't measure up to the Golden Era\n\n\nThis season's side is on pace to be towards the bottom of Leeds squads in the Premier League.\n\n\nSquad\nSeason\nGoals\nGoals Allowed\n\n\n\n\nLeeds United\n1993\n63\n39\n\n\nLeeds United\n2000\n63\n43\n\n\nLeeds United\n1998\n61\n34\n\n\nLeeds United\n2020\n60\n54\n\n\nLeeds United\n1999\n57\n43\n\n\nLeeds United\n1994\n56\n38\n\n\nLeeds United\n1992\n55\n62\n\n\nLeeds United\n2001\n54\n37\n\n\nLeeds United\n2002\n54\n57\n\n\nLeeds United\n1997\n52\n46\n\n\nLeeds United\n2025\n46\n54\n\n\nLeeds United\n2022\n45\n78\n\n\nLeeds United\n2021\n42\n79\n\n\nLeeds United\n2003\n40\n79\n\n\nLeeds United\n1995\n38\n57\n\n\nLeeds United\n1996\n27\n38\n\n\n\nBy: Justice Rhody | Source: FBRef\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain we find that Leeds isn’t measuring up well in terms of attacking numbers, but defensively they project to be pretty solid, and that removes this team from being in the bottom five Leeds squads at least on the table.\nBut how do they stack up on a scatterplot that also has a regression attached to it? Are they better than the average Leeds Premier League side over the last 16 seasons?\n\n\nCode\nleeds2025 &lt;- leeds |&gt; \n  filter(Season == \"2025\") \n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=leeds, aes(x= GlsA, y=Gls...9)) +\n  geom_point(data=leeds2025, aes(x= GlsA, y=Gls...9), color= \"blue\") +\n  geom_smooth(data=leeds, aes(x= GlsA, y=Gls...9), method= \"lm\") +  \n  geom_text_repel(data=leeds, aes(x= GlsA, y=Gls...9, label= Season)) +\n  geom_encircle(data=leeds2025, aes(x= GlsA, y=Gls...9), s_shape=.03, expand=.03, colour=\"red\") +\n  labs(\n    x= \"Goals Scored\",\n    y= \"Goals Allowed\",\n    title= \"The Current Leeds squad isn't actually that awful\",\n    subtitle= \"Based on projected goals and goals allowed, this Leeds squad is close to middle of the pack historically, and there is worse below them.\",\n    caption= \" Source: FBRef | Graphic By Justice Rhody\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=8)\n  ) + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n     panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter looking at the chart, we can see that Leeds is projected to fall below the level of an average Leeds squad in the Premier League, and on the chart are worse than the 2022 squad that got relegated to the Championship.\nBut we can also conclude by looking at the chart that they aren’t the worst Leeds United side of the Premier League era.\nThat honor belongs to the 1996-97 Leeds United squad, who actually finished 11th in the Premier League by allowing the 4th-fewest goals in the league, but also scored the least amount in the league by 3 goals, falling below relegated Nottingham Forest and relegated arch-rivals Sunderland in that abysmal attacking season."
